Java is known for its 'write once run anywhere capability', meaning
Java code can run on any platform that has a JVM installed. This platform
independence is one of the Java's Biggest Strengths.

# JDK :- THE JDK IS A COMPREHENSIVE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ENV. USED FOR DEVELOPING JAVA APPLICATIONS.
IT INCLUDES EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO DEVELOP JAVA PROGRAMS , INCLUDING :
    1.THE JAVA COMPILER(javac) : to convert your java source code(.java files)
    into bytecode(.class files).
    2.Development tools like debugger,documentation generator(javadoc).
    3.source files for java core classes.
    4.The JRE which includes JVM
#JDK hota h to develop(write) code.
#JRE hota h to execute code.

[   JDK  [ JRE  [ JVM ]  ]  ] : JDK CONTAINS JRE THAT CONTAINS JVM

#JRE:- java runtime env. is what's needed to run java applications on a comp.;
    It consists of -
    1.The JVM
    2.Compiled core classes like : String, Integer, ArrayList etc.
        and supporting files(Configuration files that tell java how to run)
    3.No dev tools unlike JDK - it's meant for end users who just want to run java apps.
    4.JRE can be installed without JDK since JRE is only needed to run java apps,
        while JDK is needed to develop them.

# JVM is the actual engine that runs the java bytecode on any platform.

A Java program runs through a clear pipeline:
1. Source Code is written in java files.
2. Compilation transforms it into platform-independent bytecode (.class).
3. Execution is handled by the JVM, which interprets the bytecode
 into native code for the specific operating system and hardware,
 allowing the program to run seamlessly across different environments.

your code is always written inside a class.

class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Hello Dosto!! ");
    }
}
This is the main method. In Java, the main method is the entry point of a program.
It has a specific signature:
class : blueprint to create instances.
public: Access modifier indicating that the method can be accessed from outside the class.
static: Indicates that the method belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class.
        if anything is declared static inside a class all the instances/objects will share it.
void: Specifies that the method does not return any value.
main: The name of the method.
String[] args: The method accepts an array of strings as parameters.
        This is where command-line arguments can be passed to your program.
