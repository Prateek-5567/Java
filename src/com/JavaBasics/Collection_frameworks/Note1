Collection Frameworks (arrays,sets etc)
    - it provides a interface and classes that help in managing group of objects.

 Before the introduction of the Collection Framework in JDK 1.2,
  Java used to rely on a variety of classes like Vector, Stack, Hashtable, and arrays
   to store and manipulate groups of objects.

However these individual classes had several drawbacks :

1  • Inconsistency: Each class had a different way of managing collections, leading to confusion
        and a steep learning curve.
2  • Lack of inter-operability: These classes were not designed to work together seamlessly.(no interconnection)
3  • No common interface: There was no common interface for all these classes, which meant
        you couldn't write generic algorithms that could operate on different types of collections.

iterable and collection are frameworks
# 1. Lists is a interface jisko implement karti hai kuch classes jese ki ArrayList , LinkedList , Vector , Stack
    - rmbr : these are classes so 1st letter capital.
        - List = ordered collection
eg ArrayList<int> => ArrayList and other classes of collection framework expects wrapper class i.e Class ke andar bhi class ki chahiye
 so ArrayList<Integer> is correct way to declare in java.

# 2. Set is a interface : implemented by some classes like HashSet , LinkedHashSet , EnumSet , TreeSet , SortedSet.
      - Set = unique values

# 3. Map interface - HashMap , LinkedHashMap  , HashTable
      - Map : Key-Value pairs.

// interface we very well know is a skeleton or structure from which classes can inherit .
